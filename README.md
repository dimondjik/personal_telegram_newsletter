# Personal Telegram Newsletter
Here's a self-hosted bot to gather all your channels in one place

# First steps
You need to create:
- A new bot (just google it, it's pretty easy)
- A new account (you will need a spare phone number)
- A telegram app (https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id)

Get api_id, api_hash and bot_id<br />
Copy sample_config.cfg file and rename it to config.cfg and paste it here

Then launch main.py script

Done!

Bot commands (they are self-explanatory):
- /subscribe
- /unsubscribe
- /list
